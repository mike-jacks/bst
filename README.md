# BST: Binary Search Tree Assignment

This was quite a challenging assignment. I was able to complete all the base challenges with little to no help from chat gpt
I think I only needed chat gpt help with remembering some pytest syntax, but I was able to follow the logic for the bst build.
When it came to delete and rebalance, I was completely lost and used chat gpt to help guide me. I understand it about 70%,
not sure if I could write it my own yet. I would like to see if there is a way to balance a tree on the fly vs calling on a method
to create a brand new tree that is sorted.

## PHP Version

Recreated the BST.py in PHP. Used phpunit to run NodeTreeTest.php.
